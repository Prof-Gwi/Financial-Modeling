# Financial-Modeling

This repository is concerned with the study of risk management in the financial marketplace, using the SAS system. The end-user is expected to have a grasp of basic statistical analysis, some familiarity with Microsoft Excel, as well as financial database platforms such as Bloomberg and Reuters. No prior programming experience is required. The first series of exercises explores financial concepts at an abstract level. The subsequent sections involve the discussion, analysis, and development of models based on data-mining techniques of real-world financial reports.
